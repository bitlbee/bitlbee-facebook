    assertion 'fb_thrift_read_stop(thft)' failed"

bitlbee-facebook-1.2.0 (2019-01-24):
  - Fix ERROR_QUEUE_OVERFLOW on login by bumping orca agent version
  - Fix "Failed to read fixed header" with TLS 1.3 / GnuTLS 3.6.x

  - Fix "Failed to read thrift" with unknown fields in /t_p payload
  - Fix rare login hang/timeout when the last page of contacts is empty

bitlbee-facebook-1.1.1 (2017-04-02):
  - Send orca-formatted user agent for all HTTP requests too. Fixes "Failed to
  parse thread information" errors when joining channels.
  - Fix typo in the month of the 1.1.0 release in the next line

bitlbee-facebook-1.1.0 (2017-03-29):
  - Fix connection errors after facebook discontinued support for old versions
  of facebook messenger for android. While most of the protocol implementation
  was already above that version, there was a subtle change that broke fetching
  of sync_sequence_id, and the previously empty MQTT user agent string is now
  considered an old version too (#138)
  - Fix receiving topic/groupchat membership events (#119)
  - Fix creating channels, inviting, kicking members (#120)
  - Fix setting channel topics (#121)
  - Fix contacts pagination for accounts with more than 500 friends (#74)
  - Fix chats with only two members including self, like the Marketplace ones
  - Fix crash on some kinds of SSL connection failure (#82)
  - Fix crash when glib is compiled with G_ENABLE_DEBUG
  - Deduplicate echoes of sent messages (#76)
  - Set a non-empty HTTP user agent for api/graphql queries, since the empty
  user agent often gets flagged for suspicious activity (#108)
  - Prevent disconnections due to contacts with incomplete profiles (#89)
  - Prevent disconnections on invalid attachment errors (#73)
  - Prevent disconnections when trying to join a chat after being kicked (#244)
  - Use FetchContactsDeltaQuery to incrementally sync contacts. Uses less
  traffic, can be done more often and fixes issues with non-friends (#116)
  - Parse URL attachments generated by the android share feature (#97)
  - Add `mark_read_reply` setting to only mark messages as read on reply (#69)
  - Add support for the bitlbee 3.5 plugin information API (bitlbee 3.4 is
  still supported by this version, but will be dropped in the next one)
  - Improve url comparison to avoid showing urls twice on attachments

bitlbee-facebook-1.0.0 (2016-01-16):
  - Initial release
